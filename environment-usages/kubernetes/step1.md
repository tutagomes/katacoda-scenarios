The Kubernetes environment is a single node Kubernetes cluster with the Master initialise using Kubeadm.

With the Kubernetes environment configured, users can focus on learning new skills on top of the platform without having to complete the steps to configure the cluster.

To provide users with feedback about when Kubernetes has been fully initialised, run the command `launch.sh`{{execute}}. This indicates to users that something is happening and when it's safe to proceed.
